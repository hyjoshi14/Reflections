Creating a remote would be most helpful once the project is ready to be shared with the public.

The benefit of having the last known state of the remote saved locally allows
for merging of divergent branches. Using commands like git fetch and git merge
(these two are essentially the basis of git pull) two branches which are out-of
-sync can be merged into one.

Without git and github version checking, conflict resolution would be harder.

Using separate branches is useful in case of experimenting so as to not affect working code
on the master.
